# Grocery-Store-Application
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for a grocery store management system. It is built using Python and Tkinter for the GUI, and MySQL for the database. The system allows users to search for products by ID, view product details, add products to a cart, and generate a bill. The bill can then be printed or saved as an RTF file.
